# concept

"""Take a diffraction pattern from silicon 110 with precession at known diffraction angle,
Run spot detection on it
User selects the opposing spots
Calculate the measured diffraction spacings
Compare these to the theoretical diffraction spacings
Work out deviation percentage
PAss spec or not...
